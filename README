A placeholder for the gitPAN project so it can have an issue tracker,
wiki and all that.

There is very little code written for gitpan.  It is mostly just gluing
together other people's work:  Leon's Parse::BACKPAN::Packages and Yanick's
git-cpan-patch.  The patched versions of these necessary to make gitpan
work are linked in as git submodules.
